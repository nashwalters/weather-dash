## General Information
There are several reasons why weather forecasts are important. Weather forecasts helps people prepare for how to dress (i.e. warm weather, cold weather, windy weather, rainy weather), helps people prepare if they need to take extra gear to prepare for the weather (i.e. umbrella, rain coat, sun screen) and well as helps people know outside weather dangers, among other important reasons.

#### Once you enter the valid city:
- You are given the current and future conditions for that city.
- You are given the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index (indicates uv condition)
